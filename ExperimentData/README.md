The experiment data for the three security groups (i.e., level 1~2, 3 and 4~5) are separately summarized in three Excel files in this folder. 

In each Excel file, on one hand, we record the execution time of user operations in the system (i.e., CertCA/ID generation, CertKE generation, certificate chain verification, CertCA/ID query, CertKE query, certificate revoke, encapsulation and decapsulation). Furthermore, we test the execution time of the basic PQ public-key cryptographic operations (i.e., signing/KEM key pair generation, CertCA/ID/KE signing and verification) in the corresponding user operations (i.e., CertCA/ID/KE generation and certificate chain verification). Roughly speaking, in most user operations, the execution time of basic PQ public-key cryptographic operations only takes a minority part of the whole execution time.

On the other hand, we also calculate and record the on-chain storage needed by our system based on different PQ public-algorithms. The on-chain storage space consists of three types of data, namely CertCA/ID (certificate for CA and user ID), CertKE (certificate for user key exchange) and EncapSec (the encapsulated shared secret).
