### Description

In our experiments, we choose one PQ signature algorithm and
one KEM algorithm at the same security level (i.e., in the same
line of Table 3). It should be mentioned that we exclude the PQ
signing algorithms Rainbow, GeMSS and the PQ KEM algorithm
Classic McEliece from our analysis, because these three
algorithms (with any parameter set) cause much more execution
time and on-chain storage than other algorithms, make the figures
almost unreadable and thus are not suitable for the consortium
blockchains.
